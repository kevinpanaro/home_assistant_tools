I store all my passwords using [password store](https://www.passwordstore.org/). Recently I decided to store all of my secrets there as well. So inside of my password repo, I have a directory called "homeassistant". Each password is stored there. So for example, if I had a password called ip_address, with my ip address, it would output my secrets.yaml as:
ip_address: 127.0.0.1 

for all of my secrets.
